Description: This tool fits a non-parametric Bayesian model called "hierarchically
            coupled mixture model (HCMM)" to the original microdata in order to generate
            synthetic microdata for privacy protection. The non-parametric feature of the
            adopted model is useful for catching the joint distribution of the original data
            in a highly flexible manner, leading to the generation of synthetic data very
            similar to the original data. Important reference papers on this method include
            Murray & Reiter (2016) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2016.1174132>.
